# Diagnosis-of-the-COVID-19
This project is aimed at improving my skills in feature engineering and machine learning with a focus on predicting COVID-19 and flu diagnoses. By utilizing a dataset of clinical and demographic features, the goal is to develop robust machine learning models that assist in accurate and timely diagnostics of respiratory illnesses. The project explores various techniques in data preprocessing, feature importance analysis, and model evaluation.

# Project Objectives
- Feature Engineering: Enhance feature engineering skills by selecting, transforming, and analyzing the most impactful features for diagnostics.
- Data Augmentation: Use techniques such as SMOTE to handle class imbalance in the dataset.
- Model Training & Evaluation: Train and evaluate several machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) with a focus on improving diagnostic accuracy and recall for minority classes.
- Feature Importance: Apply methods like Permutation Importance and Random Forest Feature Importance to assess which features are critical for making predictions.

# Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the dataset.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data encoding, and feature scaling.
- Feature Importance: Identifying key features that contribute to diagnosis prediction.
- Modeling: Training several machine learning models and comparing their performance.
- Data Augmentation: Applying SMOTE to address class imbalance.
